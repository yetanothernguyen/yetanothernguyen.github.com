h2. Debugging

Watch out for silly mistakes. Take some time to read error message to see what it is trying to tell.

h2. MongoDB

Database = Database

Collection = Table

Document = Row

Field = Column

Document has no schema. Collection can contain documents with different set of fields.

h2. Embed vs Reference

Embed when a document is always showed in the context of another. Embed document is different to search for independent of its parent.

Donâ€™t afraid to duplicate data in multiple collections.

h2. Mongoid

Problem with saving associations
