h2. Multi-tenancy strategies

Instance partitioning - Each app run on its own application server and database instance
Role Based Access Control - On view and controllers
Model partitioning - Scope model by tenants
Schema partitioning - Namespace access by schema


h2. MongoDB is good for schema partitioning

Database/collection creations on the fly.
No migration.

h2. client_side_validations gem is awesome

Can also create custom validators.
